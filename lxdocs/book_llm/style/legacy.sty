legacy.sty is a placeholder name for a local LaTeX package used to keep older or project-specific settings separate from the main, modern preamble so that documents remain backward compatible without cluttering current configuration.

​
Typical uses

    Backward compatibility: preserves old macros, deprecated package options, or legacy formatting that existing chapters or collaborators still rely on, while allowing newer settings to live elsewhere.

​

Isolation of risky tweaks: contains low-level commands (e.g., those needing makeatletter) or overrides that might conflict with newer packages, keeping them out of the primary preamble.

​

Controlled migration: serves as a staging area to gradually replace legacy commands with modern equivalents without breaking existing content.

    ​

How to deploy

    Load it at the end of the preamble chain so newer packages and styles initialize first, and legacy overrides take effect only where intended.

​

Document every macro or override inside legacy.sty with comments and version/date tags using ProvidesPackage to track provenance and ease future removal.

    ​

When to avoid it

    If no backward compatibility is needed, keep everything in modular preamble fragments and omit legacy.sty to reduce complexity and potential conflicts
