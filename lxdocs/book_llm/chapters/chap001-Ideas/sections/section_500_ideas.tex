    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Jiju: Generate viva rubrics and viva questions for a given coding problem.
        \item Jiju: record viva or interview and generate score as per coding problem.
        \item Jiju: record interview and genearte fairness score as per the rubrics.
        \item Jiju: record viva and generate score for non tech skills like communication skills, soft skills, english fluency, grammer.
        \item Jiju: Educative chatbots
        \item Jiju: Ask chatgpt about - generative AI projects in education.
        \item Technique to create distractors for mcq. 
        \item Use the technique presented in MCQ gen paper to create(generate) explanation/tutorial of a research paper. 
        \item Improve mcqGen for multiple correct choices, currently it has only one correct answers.
        \item Propose RAG for MCQ, fill in the blank or other types of questions.
        \item Propose chunking stratgy for  MCQ, fill in the blank or other types of questions.
        \item Propose  a preprocessing step for MCQ, fill in the blank or other types of questions.
        \item method to extract topics, keywords, important phrases etc from a given lesson text. Ask chatgpt what algorithm it uses to extract topics, keywords, important phrases etc from a given lesson text. Do some innovation in it.
        \item do a comparative study about 2 techniques in RAG process for generating MCQ.
        \item propose  a methods to extract topics/keywords/correct answers and distractors for mcq generation.
        \item  generate a list of questions to understand a topic.
        \item propose a new prompt creation technique to extract MCQs.
        \item give a chapter of CBSE subjects EVS, Moral science, english and generate questions and compare with CBSE books.
        \item Content generation in hindi given a english text.
        \item MCQ generation based on gaps identified for an essay written by student
        \item given an MCQ question using RAG to find alternate multiple choice options.
        \item generate concepts which forms the basis for multiple choice MCQs.
        \item generate keywords, topics using iterative self refining steps and CoT. 
        \item generate code in a programming language written in different language.
        \item Generate a list of tools/methods/methodologies used in a research paper.
        \item Generate Flowchart/Steps/Algorithm/Pipeline-stages from a research paper.
        \item Generate test cases for a given coding problem. \cite{Lee2025}
        \item generate code given class and methods with comments explaining the task to be done.
        \item evaluate students idea before writing code based on the his comments explanation the code.
        \item evaluate students understranding of a given code based on his comments before every line.
