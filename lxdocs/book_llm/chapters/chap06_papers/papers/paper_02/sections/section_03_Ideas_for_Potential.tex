    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Jiju: Generate viva rubrics and viva questions for a given coding problem.
        \item Jiju: record viva or interview and generate score as per coding problem.
        \item Jiju: record interview and genearte fairness score as per the rubrics.
        \item Jiju: record viva and generate score for non tech skills like communication skills, soft skills, english fluency, grammer.
        \item Jiju: Educative chatbots
        \item Jiju: Ask chatgpt about - generative AI projects in education.
        \item Generate an algorithmic steps given a code for a problem and evaluate it for correctness.
        \item Build similar system for javascript, html, css.
        \item generate html components for quiz
        \item Srikant sir like work : evaluate a python code. generate question and rubrics.
        \item generate a coding problem similar to a given input problem. to be put in a different sets so that 2 studentd do not cheat also both problems are of similar dificulty level.
        \item Evaluate a step by step algorithm(flowchart) to a given python problem for beginners.
		\item Explanation generation of the error while coding. code and error and input and the generate explanation of the  error and possible correction. Include rubrics etc.
		\item Valuation of code using LLM.
		\item Programming questions generation using LLM, Los and rubrics.
