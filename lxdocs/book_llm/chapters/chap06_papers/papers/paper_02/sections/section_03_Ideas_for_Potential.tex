    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Build similar system for javascript, html, css.
        \item generate html components for quiz
        \item Srikant sir like work : evaluate a python code. generate question and rubrics.
        \item generate a coding problem similar to a given input problem. to be put in a different sets so that 2 studentd do not cheat also both problems are of similar dificulty level.
        \item Evaluate a step by step algorithm(flowchart) to a given python problem for beginners.
		\item Explanation generation of the error while coding. code and error and input and the generate explanation of the  error and possible correction. Include rubrics etc.
		\item Valuation of code using LLM.
		\item Programming questions generation using LLM, Los and rubrics.
		\item Build similar system for javascript, html, css.
