\section{Summerize abstract for me in easy language for a novice in very easy sentences. }
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This paper proposes a GPT-4o-based code review system for python that provides accurate feedback(comments).
    \item The system tells students what is wrong and which lines they should fix
    \item Reducing token usage and preventing AI-assisted cheating
    \item The results suggest this system can help teachers and make it easier for school students to learn programming.
    \item Use of LLMs in class allows AI-assisted cheating. If novice learners use ChatGPT to easily generate code to solve problems, their learning effectiveness may decrease.
    \item  introduces a Review Necessity Chain (RNC) to reduce unnecessary feedback and API usage
    \item Research Questions
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Does the Code Correctness Check Module improve the relative error detection rate compared to a traditional online judge system?
        \item  How semantically similar is the feedback generated by the Code Review Module (CRM) to those produced by human instructors?
        \item Does the pipeline of the CRM effectively reduce unnecessary reviews while retaining essential feedback?
        \item Can the proposed code review system improve learning efficiency and reduce instructors’ feedback workload in large-scale educational settings?
      \end{enumerate}
