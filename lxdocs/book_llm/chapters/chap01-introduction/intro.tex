\section{What LLMs do}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Probabilistic sequence models
		\item They donâ€™t plan full sentences; they add one token at a time.
		\item Guess the next token based on previous tokens.
		\item Each new word is chosen based on probabilities calculated from the words before it.
		\item The model does not decide the whole sentence at once, it builds it step by step.
	\end{enumerate}
