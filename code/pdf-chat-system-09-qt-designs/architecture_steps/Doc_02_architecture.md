> `Three Types Of Class for UI`

| Class Type | Count | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Component** | Many | Render UI widgets. Emit signals. Nothing else. |
| **ComponentController** | One per smart component | Handle UI-only actions for their component |
| **UIComposer** | Exactly one | Create **MainWindow**, instantiate and lay out all components, create all **ComponentControllers**, return **AppControllers** bundle |

<br>

> `Four Types Of Class for Services`

| Class Type | Count | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Service** | Many | Perform one raw operation using simple data types |
| **DomainController** | One per service/domain | Handle business logic and external services |
| **ServiceComposer** | Exactly one | Instantiate all domain controllers, load API key from **.env**, return **DomainControllers** bundle |
| **Domain Models** | Many | MainController and  DomainController exchange information using these models|

<br>

> `One MainController`

| Class Type | Count | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **MainController** | Exactly one | Orchestrate the full event flow across the app |

---

## Bundles (frozen dataclasses)

| Class | Type | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `AppControllers` | `@dataclass(frozen=True)` | one field for each component controller |
| `DomainControllers` | `@dataclass(frozen=True)` | one field for each domain controller |

---

```

## Component( Key responsibilities )

- Dumb Renderer : receive data and update UI
- Create UI Elements
- Build Layout
- Emit a external signal when a user interaction occurs
- Handle internal signals (scrolling, focus, hover, animations)
- Manage Internal UI State
- If possible prefer external styling over inline(internal) styling of UI Widgets.
- Never call the controller directly
- Never read from or write to another component
- do not decide what happens after an event
- Do not call any controller method directly
- do not interact with other components
- do not access global/application state

---

## ComponentController ( Key responsibilities )

- A non-widget class that **manages one smart component**.
- One controller per smart component (our app)
- Contains only operation methods that are called during event handling 
- there can be one or more methods corrosponding to an event.
- Owns all UI-level logic for that component
- Manage internal UI state of its component
- Acts as the bridge between MainController and the Component
- Ensures the component remains dumb and passive
- Never contain business logic
- Never communicate with other `ComponentController`s directly
---

## DomainController or ServiceControllers (Key responsibilities)

- A plain class that **handles one domain of business logic or one external service**
- Contains only operation methods that are called during event handling
- It knows nothing about the UI. Never update the UI directly
- Perform a specific business operation when called
- Return a result or raise a descriptive exception
- Receive a domain model, unpack it into simple types, call the raw service
- Assemble the result into domain model and returns back to main_controller
  back into a domain model to return
- Communicates only via MainController
- Never communicate with other `DomainController`s directly
- Never communicate with other `ComponentController`s directly
---

## UIComposer (Key responsibilities)

- A plain class that **builds the entire UI** 
- single place where all components and component controllers are created
- Creates `MainWindow` and adds all components to it with correct layout
- Instantiates all `ComponentControllers` and passes each one its component
- Returns refrences of all component controllers as a frozen bundle
- Main controller need it get refrences of all component controllers 

---

## DomainComposer (Key responsibilities)

- A plain class that **builds all domain services** 
- the single place where all domain controllers are created
- Loads the settings from `.env` file at startup
- Instantiates all `DomainControllers`
- Returns refrences of all domain controllers as a frozen bundle
- Main controller need it get refrences of all domain controllers 

## MainController (Key responsibilities)

- The **single orchestrator** for the entire application.
- Only class that knows the full sequence of steps for every user event.
- Connect all component signals to handler methods on startup
- Define the complete step-by-step flow for every user event
- Call `DomainController`s for business logic
- Call `ComponentController`s to update the UI
- Handle errors and decide how to surface them
- Do not contain low-level UI code. Delegate to `ComponentController`
- Do not contain business logic (no PDF parsing, no API calls). Delegate to `DomainController`

## Models
  - Use Pydantic only at boundaries where data comes from outside. Use dataclass for internal app models.

> we have try catch to handle same error in both DomainController and MainController. DomainController catches Raw library exceptions and raises clean domain error. MainController catches Clean domain errors and decides what to do next. This is the standard pattern for layered architectures. Each layer only speaks the language of the layer above it.

## State Change Decision

### Decision: controller-driven UI updates (not state-driven / reactive)

For this app we chose a **simple controller-driven approach** over a reactive state pattern (like signals on a shared `AppState` object).

This means: **`MainController` explicitly calls `ComponentController` methods to update the UI** after every event. There is no observable state object that components watch automatically.

### Why this approach fits our app

| Factor | Reason |
|---|---|
| Small app | Only 4 user events, 12 components — reactive overhead not justified |
| Linear flows | Each event has a clear, predictable sequence of steps |
| Beginner-friendly | Explicit calls are easier to read, trace, and debug than reactive subscriptions |
| No cross-cutting state | No component needs to react to state it didn't directly cause |

### Rule
> Every UI update in this app is an **explicit method call** made by `MainController` or a `ComponentController`. No component updates itself in response to a shared state object.
