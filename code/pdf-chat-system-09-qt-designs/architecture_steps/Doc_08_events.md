## Notes

| Note | Detail |
|---|---|
| E-04          | Event triggered by two triggers. Both map to the same handler in `MainController`. |
| E-02 and E-03 | These are outcomes of E-01. The file picker is opened by E-01; success → E-02, failure → E-03. |
| No E for API response | API call is blocking on main thread (NFR-01). No async event needed — response arrives inline. |
| No E for scroll | Scrolling is internal UI behavior managed by `ChatAreaController`. Not a user event. |
